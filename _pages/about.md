# üÜî About Me
I am a Ph.D. candidate at Tongji University, advised by Prof. [Guanjun Liu](https://flml.tongji.edu.cn/info/1094/1116.htm). I was a visiting student at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, advised by Prof. [MengChu Zhou](https://web.njit.edu/~zhou/).

My research interests include multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning, and trustworthy AI, as well as their applications in human-cyber-physical systems (e.g., autonomous UAV collaboration).
